# TrumpScraper
A basic web scraper that analyzed one of Trump's campaign speeches online. The scraper looked for the contexts in which certain words were used. The speech analyzed can be found here: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/08/19/donald-trumps-best-speech-of-the-2016-campaign-annotated/?utm_term=.27e983cc1748


Using the scraper:

Linux or MacOS systems: 

Once you've downlaoded the repo, navigate to the directory where it is installed. 

Type in 'python3 -i scraper.py'.
Once you're running the interpreter, simply type in 'get_associated_words()' and enter whatever word you want to search for as the parameter. 

Requirements:

Make sure you have the nltk and Beautiful Soup python libraries installed. The scraper won't run otherwise.
