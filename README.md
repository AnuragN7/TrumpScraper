# TrumpScraper
A basic web scraper that analyzed one of Trump's campaign speeches online. The scraper looked for the contexts in which certain words were used.


Using the scraper:

Linux or MacOS systems: 

Once you've downlaoded the repo, navigate to the directory where it is installed. 

Run the command 'python3 -i scraper.py'
Once you're running the interpreter, simply type in the 'get_associated_words()' and enter whatever word you want to search for as the parameter. 

Requiremeents:

Make sure you have python3, nltk, and Beautiful Soup installed. The scraper won't run otherwise.
